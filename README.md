I’m a curious and creative dev who enjoys writing clean code, designing interfaces that feel nice to use, and building things that people actually enjoy. I’ve worked on all sorts of stuff — from train simulations in Java to music platforms and journaling apps with quests. I like learning by doing and figuring things out along the way (even if it means breaking stuff a few times).

🚀 Currently exploring: Cloud computing, backend architecture, and all things JavaScript + TypeScript. Always keen on picking up new tools and frameworks just for the fun of it.

⚡ Fun fact: I write better commit messages than texts to my friends.
